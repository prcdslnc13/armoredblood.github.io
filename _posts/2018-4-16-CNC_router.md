This is a quick dump of the progression of my CNC router that started my journey in home manufacturing.

#The Beginning
It started with a variation on the Rockcliff CNC router design that has become so prevalent with the moving bed and fixed gantry. If you click the videos - Audio warning- ITS LOUD. I had no idea what I was doing then haha.
