MakersOnTap Podcast
-----

In the summer of 2018 two friends and I started a podcast where we try tasty new beers and discuss Maker Space leadership, the Maker Community and navigating it while staying sane and keeping our families together.

It's a weekly podcast and about once a month we bring on leaders in the community and maker businesses and interview them about what drives their contributions to the community.
