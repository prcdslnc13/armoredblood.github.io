A sample of some of the cooler router projects I have done in the last couple years

Fusion360 Cam Challenge
------
This was a Fusion coin for one of the first Fusion360 CAM Challenges. It was a lot of fun to make and a good test of my machine because I had just upgraded the spindle and added mist coolant. I think with some tuning I could have gotten it really nice. But alas, time...

Fuel Catch
------
I created a chemical resistant fuel catch for a fire performance festival in Indiana. The whole structure is made from HDPE and routed on a friends 4x8' cnc router. I never got to roll down a hill in it unfortunately but it did recollect several gallons of fuel over the weekend festival

Skella-Stega
------
This was a super fun project I did very early on in my CNC journey. I scaled the parts as big as I could to still be able to fit on my 2'x4' machine in its first revision. There was probably 15 hours cut time over two days. It's currently being enjoyed by my friends two lucky little boys.

RCL Community Paint
------
I made this on my CNC router at work and put it together as a Community art project for Midwest MakerFest, that I help organize every year. Kids were given a variety of paint, tools, and textures to add to the project. The results are hanging in our Maker Space for all to see.

Whiskey City Dressing room
------
This is a folding portable dressing room for a local Burlesque troupe I do work for. This was a really fun project to do as it included fabric multiple textures. I wanted it to be a really great back drop for their shows and showcase their branding in a memorable fashion.
