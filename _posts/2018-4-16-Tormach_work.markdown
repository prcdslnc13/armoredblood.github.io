A sample of some of the cooler Tormach projects I have done in the last year

4th axis and mixed drilling
------
Unfortunately much of the work I did on the Tormach machines I ran at my last position is tied behind NDA's but this is a compilation of videos that are safe to show.

For  the mill it includes some 4th axis work using a tombstone fixture we made to machine 4 parts and different operations at once.

On the SlantPro lathe, it shows a drill op with a Shar's combo drill, using it for facing, drilling and boring in one op. I had to modify the Fusion post-processor to be able to easily call the tool offsets to do this but it worked out well.
