 RiverCitylabs
----
RiverCitylabs started as a late night talk in a coffee shop after I gave a talk on 3D printing in 2012. Since then has grown to a fully operational 501(c)(3) organization with over 50 full time members and a deeply dedicated board of directors.

We are the only makerspace of our kind in the surrounding area and therefore pull membership from all of our surrounding cities.

RiverCitylabs runs on a philosophy of "Radical Acts of Sharing" and therefore encourages the use and proliferation of Free (as in speech and beer where appropriate) and Opensource software and hardware.

When we say we built a makerspace we really mean it. Many of our tools were designed and built by our members (including me) and where not we try to buy equipment to support good maker based companies like [Lulzbot](www.lulzbot.com)

We also put on the largest makerfest event in down state IL called [Midwest MakerFest](https://prcdslnc13.github.io/MidwestMakerFest/)
